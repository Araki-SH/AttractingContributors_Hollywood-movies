# My Project
## What to do on holidays?

What do you do on days when you are free from classes and research?

Or do you escape from reports and research?

Please let us know what you do!

And enjoy your day off!

Well, the day I post this is Monday.

# Rules
1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository

2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)

3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.
